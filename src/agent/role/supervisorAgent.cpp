A port is a named, configured transport endpoint such as a serial port, TCP client, or SSL client. Lua scripts interact with configured ports through UniComm APIs: port.* provides raw I/O, while protocol APIs such as Modbus RTU, Modbus TCP, HTTP, and MQTT operate on a configured port by name.\n\n"

Do not dispatch dependent tasks concurrently. Use one concurrent subagent_dispatch call only for tasks that are genuinely independent.\n\n"
